      <h1 class="animate__animated animate__backInDown">About ME</h1>
      <p class="animate__animated animate__backInLeft">Hello! I’m John Jeslhee M. Del Rosario, a dedicated student from Malolos, Bulacan, born on December 15, 2001. I’m
      currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a major in Computer Science at Bulacan State University,
      where I’ve been honing my analytical and problem-solving skills. My passion for technology led me to dive into web
      development, where I’ve developed beginner-level proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love experimenting with
      code to create user-friendly, visually appealing websites and am always eager to learn new techniques to elevate my
      craft.</p>
      <p class="animate__animated animate__backInRight">My journey in computer science has been both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to explore the endless
        possibilities of software development. From building simple webpages to tackling small projects, I’m driven by a
        curiosity to understand how things work behind the scenes and a desire to create solutions that make a difference.
        Beyond academics, I’m an active individual who enjoys playing basketball, biking through scenic routes, and embracing
        new challenges that fuel my personal and professional growth. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled full-stack
        developer, crafting innovative and impactful web applications that connect people and ideas.
