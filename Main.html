            <h1>About ME</h1>
            <p>Hello! I’m John Jeslhee M. Del Rosario, a dedicated student
                from Malolos, Bulacan, born on December 15, 2001. I’m
                currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a major in Computer Science at Bulacan State
                University,
                where I’ve been honing my analytical and problem-solving skills. My passion for technology led me to dive
                into web
                development, where I’ve developed beginner-level proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love
                experimenting with
                code to create user-friendly, visually appealing websites and am always eager to learn new techniques to
                elevate my
                craft.</p>
            <p>My journey in computer science has been both challenging and
                rewarding, pushing me to explore the endless
                possibilities of software development. From building simple webpages to tackling small projects, I’m driven
                by a
                curiosity to understand how things work behind the scenes and a desire to create solutions that make a
                difference.
                Beyond academics, I’m an active individual who enjoys playing basketball, biking through scenic routes, and
                embracing
                new challenges that fuel my personal and professional growth. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled
                full-stack
                developer, crafting innovative and impactful web applications that connect people and ideas.
